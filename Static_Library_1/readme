List of fils:
=============
./mylibrary.h         (Header file for the library)
./mylibrary.cpp       (Source file for the library)
./mylibrary.o         (Compiled object file for the library)
./libmylibrary.a      (Static library file)
./main.cpp            (Main program source file)
./main                (Generated executable file)

Commands:
=========
1. Compile the library:  "g++ -c mylibrary.cpp -o mylibrary.o"
2. Create the Static library: "ar rcs libmylibrary.a mylibrary.o"
3. Compile and link the main program: "g++ -o main mylibrary.o -L. libmylibrary.a"
4. Run the program: "./main"

Steps:
======
1. First create the Headerfile -> "filename.h".
2. Then create the .cpp file (Mention the created header file name in the .cpp file "#include "mylibrary.h" ")
3. Use a C++ compiler to generate an object file from mylibrary.cpp (execute the above 1st command).
4. Use the ar command to create the static library from the object file.(Execute the above 2nd command).
5. Create a separate C++ program that uses the library.
6. Use the static library when compiling the main program. (Execute the above 3rd command).
7. Run the main program (Execute the 4th command)
8. Now you becomes the expected output.
